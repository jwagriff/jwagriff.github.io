While you may be able to get lucky at thrift stores, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantees out there for quality. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget, five-fretted Guitar Hero controllers were first made all the way back in 2006; so it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that a lot of them have seen better days.\nFast forward to 2023 and there\u0026rsquo;s some glimmers of hope. The Clone Hero community has banded together to create all sorts of modifications like mechanical frets, 3D printable, drop-in replacement parts, and even full guitar bodies.\nMy friends and I have recently been jamming out on Clone Hero in the evenings, and as we bashed away at our now almost 16 year old guitars, we got to thinking: are there any good quality, fully 3D printed guitars out there?\nAfter hours of scouring Thingiverse, one of which stood out to us the most. Introducing: the Polybar, courtesy of roadsidebomb.\nIn this article, I will be providing a guide on how I personally built my own Polybar. Many of the steps have already been discussed in other guides, such as those that explain how to retrofit an Arduino into an official controller, but the Polybar is a little different due to it being entirely 3D printed.\nThis guide includes the instructions I followed on preparing the printed parts, as well as wiring and configuring the electronics. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin!\nPre-requisites\u003e Pre-requisites # Before proceeding, you\u0026rsquo;ll need the following:\n3D printer and filament 7x full-size, mechanical keyboard switches (5 linear, 2 clicky) X M5 20mm bolts 1x M5 35mm bolts X M5 x 10 x 7mm threaded inserts 4x 6x6x4.5mm microswitches 1x Arduino compatible joystick board X strands of AWG 30-32 wire 1x Adruino Pro Micro (or clone) 1x USB-C cable Soldering iron Hot glue Ardwiino Guitar Configuration Tool by Sanjay The latest project files (credits to roadsidebomb on Github) Heatgun (Optional) Sandpaper (Optional) Step 1: Printing test\u003e Step 1: Printing test # First we must discuss the printing process. Once downloading the files from roadsidebomb\u0026rsquo;s Github, simply open them in your preferred slicing program (I\u0026rsquo;m using Prusaslicer).\nParts can be printed in two batches: In one batch you\u0026rsquo;ll have the internal boards used to hold switches in place, as well as any button heads; in the second, you\u0026rsquo;ll have the body of the Polybar itself. The body can be printed either with or without an extension that sits between the strumbar and the frets to give it a more traditional controller length.\nThe only settings worth noting are as follows:\nInfill: 20% Infill type: Gyroid etc ","date":"January 29, 2022","permalink":"/posts/polybar-build-guide/","section":"Posts","summary":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to assemble the Polybar, a 3D printed Guitar Hero controller.
