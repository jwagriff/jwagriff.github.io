While you may be able to get lucky at thrift stores, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantees out there for quality.\nFast forward to 2023 and there\u0026rsquo;s some glimmers of hope. The Clone Hero community has banded together to create all sorts of modifications like mechanical frets, 3D printable, drop-in replacement parts, and even full guitar bodies.\nIn this article, I will explain how I built my own Polybar, courtesy of roadsidebomb. Many of the steps have already been discussed in other guides, such as those that explain how to retrofit an Arduino into an official controller, but the Polybar is a little different due to it being entirely 3D printed.\nThis guide includes the instructions I followed on preparing the printed parts, as well as wiring and configuring the electronics. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin!\nPre-requisites\u003e Pre-requisites # Before proceeding, you\u0026rsquo;ll need the following:\n3D printer and filament 7x full-size, mechanical keyboard switches (5 linear, 2 clicky) 2 M5 20mm bolts 1x M5 35mm bolt 3 M5 x 10 x 7mm threaded inserts 3x 6x6x4.5mm microswitches 1x Arduino compatible joystick board Colour-coded strands of AWG 30-32 wire 1x Adruino Pro Micro (or clone) 1x USB-C cable Soldering iron Hot glue Sandpaper or filing tool Pliers Super glue Ardwiino Guitar Configuration Tool by Sanjay The latest project files (credits to roadsidebomb on Github) OR Bengyboo on printables has made a modified Flying V frame that allows for more secure installation. Heatgun (Optional) Solder flux (Optional) Print Process\u003e Print Process # First we must discuss the printing process. Once downloading the files from roadsidebomb\u0026rsquo;s Github, simply open them in your preferred slicing program (I\u0026rsquo;m using Prusaslicer).\nParts can be printed in two batches: In one batch you\u0026rsquo;ll have the internal boards used to hold switches in place, as well as any button heads; in the second, you\u0026rsquo;ll have the body of the Polybar itself. The body can be printed either with or without an extension that sits between the strumbar and the frets to give it a more traditional controller length.\nTest Fitting\u003e Test Fitting # Before we assemble anything, it\u0026rsquo;s important to test fit the parts to ensure everything plays together nicely. It\u0026rsquo;s likely you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make some minor adjustments to the guitar before starting the main portion of the build. Nothing too extreme, we just want to remove as much support material as possible on the internal boards, dovetail connectors, and well, anything else.\nOne you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied that everything is smooth, the test fit can begin!\nNote: The Polybar comes with an optional extension to give a slightly longer neck. I decided to use this, and glued the whole top section together at the dovetail joints to make disassembly much simpler. This is optional, but just thought you should know!\nStrum Case Assembly\u003e Strum Case Assembly # Before assembling the strum case, take the two internal strum bar boards and place a blue switch in either one. On top of the switch, you\u0026rsquo;ll need the rectangular shaped switch cap to be placed like so:\nThe joystick board goes at the bottom, the two blue switch holders go in the middle, and the two microswitch holders go at the top. There are notches along the small railings on the inside of the case to help you place things in the right location, so I tend to slide these along until I get a good fit.\nNow we move to the top section of the strum box. We first want to get the actual strum bar itself installed. To do this, lay the strum bar itself inside and then take the two plungers and insert them through the raised sections located either side of the strum bar. Flip the piece around and move the strum bar from up to down and ensure everything operates smoothly. If it does, flip the board around once more and place the plunger covers over the top of the raised sections. These will prevent the plungers from accidentally falling out.\nAnother thing to do would be to check that the buttons fit into their respective slots. The top two buttons are the same size, and the bottom button is slightly smaller. We won\u0026rsquo;t be able to check the joystick head fit just yet, but you can always lay it on top to see if it covers the hole. Be sure to remove these after you\u0026rsquo;ve verified that everything fits.\nFret Button Assembly\u003e Fret Button Assembly # To test the fret button assembly, we first want to place the linear switches into the 5 slots on the internal board.\nSimply press each switch into place until you hear a click. After that, insert the switch caps into each switch\nWe can now slide the fret board into the bottom half of the neck shell. Similarly to the strum case buttons, there are notches to help you find the right location.\nOnce this is in place, take the fret buttons and place them on top of each switch cap. Line them up so that they\u0026rsquo;re all straight to make the next step a bit easier.\nThe fret buttons have a tear drop cut out on the bottom to make removing them a bit easier, but the orientation that you install them in doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter (These buttons require some sanding, so I tend to orient them so that the sanded side is facing away from me when holding the guitar).\nClosing the Polybar\u003e Closing the Polybar # Looking at the top side of the strum bar, the bottom has a triangle that is designed to be inserted into the bottom casing at an angle.\nTo fit both sides of the polybar together, simply lay the top of the shell into the bottom at an angle. You\u0026rsquo;ll see that the trianglular piece above slots into a cut out on the bottom shell. Once these are lined up, lower the top portion downward until both pieces clamp together. You may need to wiggle the pieces around a bit to get everything sliding down correctly, but take your time; it\u0026rsquo;ll fit!\nNote: If you too glued the top part together, try moving from the bottom of the shell upward, clicking each part together as you go. This should avoid excess strain on the joints.\nIf everything fits; congratulations! Now on to the shell.\nShell Assembly\u003e Shell Assembly # Shell assembly will vary depending on which guitar shape you choose, but the process is relatively uniform.\nEach shell comes in two parts; one top, one bottom. The top section can (and probably should) be glued together to ensure a nice even fit.\nIf your Polybar is assembled, you first need to take the top case off and remove the two neck pieces. This leaves you with just the strum case. The strum case slides into the shell at an angle, and can sometimes feel a bit uncomfortable. Be persistent, and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to bend the plastic pieces slightly.\nIf the fit is too tight, feel free to file away some of the plastic in the lower portion. I do recommend doing this, especially if you\u0026rsquo;ll be swapping frames out quite often.\nNote: In the pre-requisites, I have listed alternative downloads for a flying V shell that my friend modified. This allows the Polybar and the frame to be secured via one M5 35mm bolt.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re happy that the body of your Polybar is secure, you can go ahead and reverse those prior instructions to get everything disassembled.\nInitial Soldering Joints\u003e Initial Soldering Joints # Now, the fun part; soldering!\nSoldering novices need not worry. Before this project, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t touched a soldering iron since my days in secondary school and mine turned out just fine. Sure, it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect, but it works!\nSwitches\u003e Switches # First, let\u0026rsquo;s look at preparing our fret button/strum bar switches.\nEach switch requires two wires: one of them is our ground wire, the other gets connected to an available pin on the Pro Micro.\nFret Buttons/Strum Bar\u003e Fret Buttons/Strum Bar # For the fret buttons, cut 10 strands of wire measuring from top to bottom of your Polybar (2 green, 2 red, 2 yellow, etc). Without an extension, this works out to 40cm, and 55cm with an extension. I\u0026rsquo;d advise leaving an additional 5cm or so on the ends, just in case we need more.\nThis is where the colour coded wire comes in extremely helpful. My kit came with all the fret button colours, apart from orange. For orange, I used one red wire and one yellow wire.\nOnce these are cut, solder one wire to each pin for all five fret buttons. For added security, install a piece of heatshrink around your solder joint, and then twist the wires around eachother to keep things tidy.\nRepeat this process for your two tactile strum bar switches, but feel free to cut much less wire. I found that 15cm worth did the trick for both buttons.\nMicroswitches\u003e Microswitches # This process is much the same for our three microswitches. A word of caution here, though: the mounts for these switches are keyed, and can thus only be soldered in a specific way.\nYou must ensure that you solder the opposing pins on each switch. As you can see above, my first attempt resulted in me wiring up the wrong pins. To be sure, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend firstly dry fitting your switches into the mount to get the correct orientation. The printed part has a larger cut out for which pins you need to solder, and can be helpful if you get stuck.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve soldered everything correctly, insert the microswitches into their holding brackets, and once again twist the wires around to make everything neat. I like to add a dab of hot glue to the microswitch housing to keep them from moving around too much.\nJoystick\u003e Joystick # Your joystick board has five pins: GND (Ground), +5V, VRX, VRY and SW.\nSolder a piece of wire to each of these pins, but don\u0026rsquo;t heat shrink them. The plastic mount that the joystick sits on has just enough allowance to permit the pins to arch their way over the little ridge. Heatshrinking this section would just make our lives more difficult.\nSomething you can also do here is heat up the plastic mount so that the material is slightly flexible, and then press in the joystick board to create indents from the exposed solder joints underneath. This will help it sit nice and flush.\nAssembly\u003e Assembly # With our main soldering joints made, we can now start to piece the Polybar together.\nFret Buttons\u003e Fret Buttons # For the fret buttons, I prefer to install the switches in an up-down-up-down configuration. This makes cable management just a tiny bit easier and prevents them from bunching up once the board is glued in place.\nWith your green fret placed in top position, distribute the wires evenly on either side of the board as they travel down the neck. Then, add a line of super glue on the rails that the fret board sits on, and press it in place.\nI used clamps to keep mine held together for about 5 minutes.\nBengyboo on printables designed these small \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo; shaped clips that go inside the extension section to keep the wires neat and tidy. I highly recommend them.\nOnce the glue is set, take one wire from each fret button and solder them to a single strand of red wire. This will act as our ground connection.\nJoystick\u003e Joystick # For the joystick, I decided to bridge the connection between both the microswitch on the Polybar and the switch in the joystick. This is optional, but will allow me to use both buttons to activate the same function in Clone Hero (I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of what else I could map the joystick click to anyways!).\nIf you want to do this, simply solder one of your microswitch wires to the \u0026lsquo;SW\u0026rsquo; pin on the joystick board, and one to the \u0026lsquo;GND\u0026rsquo; pin.\nInstalling the joystick is very simple. Just place a dab of hot glue on the plastic bracket and seat the board in place. You may also want to glue in the microswitch, as it tends to wobble around a bit.\nStrum Bar Switches\u003e Strum Bar Switches # The boards for the strum bar switches have a slightly raised section denoting the top side of the board. These should face outwards when installed, as pictured above.\nLike with the fret buttons, feed the wire for your strum switches through the square cut out, and click the switches themselves into place. Then, take one wire from each switch (In my case, the black wire) and solder them to one wire for your ground.\nAt this point, I glued my top microswitch board in place to keep the majority of the wiring contained.\nWiring To the Pro Micro\u003e Wiring To the Pro Micro # When wiring to the Pro Micro, I recommend laying a thin layer of flux over the top of the solder joints on the bottom of the board. This will ensure everything flows correctly and prevents double joints.\nYou have two options with wiring to the Pro Micro. You can either solder your wires directly to the board, or you can solder on some pins to the board, and then solder your wires to those instead. For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, I chose to wire directly to the board.\nI\u0026rsquo;d first start by wiring all three of your ground connections to the GND pins to get them out of the way.\nAfter that, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to solder all five of your fret buttons. I chose pins 2 through 7 for the fret buttons; 8 and 9 for the strum bar switches, and 10 and 11 for the remaining two microswitches.\nFor your joystick, wire the 5V pin to VCC; SW to pin 12; VRX to A0 and VRY to A1.\nYou should then be left with a board looking something like this.\nFirmware Configuration\u003e Firmware Configuration # Before you set everything in its final resting place, a good idea would be to connect a USB cable to your Pro Micro and open sanjay\u0026rsquo;s Guitar Configurator.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go into too much detail about how to program your device, as sanjay has already created a wonderful write-up on exactly that.\nHowever, I did have some difficulty with the joystick. Specifically, getting it to work correctly.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll want to set the Joystick X Axis to left or right on the stick, and Whammy to up or down.\nWith those assigned, click \u0026ldquo;Calibrate Joystick X Axis\u0026rdquo;. A window will pop up asking you to mover your axis to the minimum value, in this case, we want to move the stick to the left and click okay. At the next prompt; do the opposite. Leave the deadzone as is and click okay.\nAfter that, click \u0026ldquo;Calibrate Whammy\u0026rdquo;. In the window that pops up, move the joystick upwards, and in the next window; do the opposite. Leave the deadzone as is like before, and click okay.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve now calibrated your controller\u0026rsquo;s thumbstick/whammy!\nFinishing Touches\u003e Finishing Touches # With everything wired up, it\u0026rsquo;s now just a case of doing your best to get your cables stuffed in the strum bar case. I wish there was more method to the madness, but it really is just a case of put it where it will go.\nHowever, I can say this: make sure you glue the Pro Micro in place by the USB-C opening before glueing anything else down. This will help you make better judgements on how much slack there is in your wiring.\nWith your bottom shell finished, all that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is to install the three threaded inserts into the top half of the shell. This video by 3D Printing World should explain how to do that.\nCongratulations. Your Polybar is finished!\n","date":"January 29, 2022","permalink":"/posts/polybar-build-guide/","section":"Posts","summary":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to assemble the Polybar, a 3D printed Guitar Hero controller.

Logitech acquired Blue and all its assets back in 2018, and has since been working to integrate Blue products into its software catalogue.\nFor the most part, this transition process has been seamless. Plugging in your Blue Yeti to a system with Logitech Gaming Software installed should have it show up in the program as a tuneable device, with features like Blue Vo!ce.\nHowever, this isn\u0026rsquo;t always the case. If you, like me, bought a Yeti a few years before Logitech acquired Blue, you may have noticed that your microphone will occasionally (or always) show up as a \u0026ldquo;USB Advanced Audio Device\u0026rdquo; in Windows sound mixer and device manager. This of course locks you out of any snazzy new features, which can severely impact audio quality.\nThankfully, not all hope is lost. With some clever driver modifications, you can restore your Yetis functionality to full capacity. Learn how to do it, here.\nWhy Does This Happen?\u003e Why Does This Happen? # Firstly, you might be wondering what causes this issue in the first place. Unfortunately, the answer isn\u0026rsquo;t very straightforward. A quick Google search shows the problem cropping up all over the internet, with no direct cause referenced by keen-eyed troubleshooters, or Blue/Logitech.\nThe closest thing I could from Blue themselves was this tweet where Blue referred to the issue as a \u0026ldquo;Ghost Microphone\u0026rdquo;. Though, it seems this refers to a hardware fault, which is not the problem at hand.\nAs a result, we\u0026rsquo;re left only to speculate why this problem occurs. I experienced similar behaviour on a Blue Snowball I had many years ago, and I mostly chocked that up to improper usage through frequent disconnects to my USB ports. The most likely cause is that the chip responsible for holding your Yetis firmware has gradually failed, and needs re-writing. Which is exactly what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do!\nHow to Fix Unrecognised Blue Yeti (USB Advanced Audio Device Fix)\u003e How to Fix Unrecognised Blue Yeti (USB Advanced Audio Device Fix) # Although this issue may sound complex, fixing it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be simpler. All you need is a program called CM64xx from Samson, and a bit of know-how.\n1. Finding VID and PID Values\u003e 1. Finding VID and PID Values # Open Device Manager and navigate to your corrupted Yeti (this should appear as \u0026ldquo;Microphone (USB Advanced Audio Device)\u0026rdquo;), right click it, and select \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026rdquo;.\nIn the window that pops up, select the \u0026ldquo;Details\u0026rdquo; tab, and change the dropdown menu underneath \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Primary\u0026rdquo;. This should give you a result that looks like this:\nUSB\\VID_XXXX\u0026amp;PID_XXXX\u0026amp;MI_00\\7\u0026amp;2754ceac\u0026amp;0\u0026amp;0000 What we\u0026rsquo;re really interested in here is the four characters next to VID_ and PID_ . Make a note of these for the next step.\n2. Connecting to the Yeti\u003e 2. Connecting to the Yeti # Download CM64xx, and open it up to the \u0026ldquo;USB Config\u0026rdquo; tab on top.\nMirror Link Coming Soon\nBack in CM64xx, cast your eyes to the bottom of the USB Config screen, specifically the VID and PID section. In here, punch in the values you gathered from step 1 and click \u0026ldquo;Connect\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter this, you may see a dialogue box pop up containing the error \u0026ldquo;EEPROM Empty\u0026rdquo;. Feel free to ignore this and just click Accept.\n3. Backup the Broken Firmware\u003e 3. Backup the Broken Firmware # Now that we\u0026rsquo;re connected to the Yeti, the first thing we\u0026rsquo;ll do is back up the existing EEPROM (even if it is reportedly empty) just in case anything goes wrong.\nTo do this, click the \u0026ldquo;EEPROM \u0026gt; File\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom of CM64xx. Be sure to choose a memorable name for this, such as \u0026ldquo;backup.bin\u0026rdquo;.\n4. Flash the fixed Firmware\u003e 4. Flash the fixed Firmware # With your firmware backed up, we can now start the flashing process. Different model microphones have different values required for here, so I\u0026rsquo;ll drop a table with these at the bottom of this section.\nAt the top of CM64xx, you\u0026rsquo;ll see sections labelled \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;String\u0026rdquo;. In the ID section, fill in the corresponding VID and PID values for your microphone. The same goes for the Manufacturer String and Product String.\nTo find your devices Serial String, open up the EEPROM backup you made in step 3 in a hex editor of your choice.\nSomewhere around lines 60 - 80, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a 20 character list of numbers separated by underscores and forward slashes. Copy this and enter it into the Serial String section of CM64xx.\nNext, navigate to the Volume, EQ and Misc. Config tabs and ensure all your values line up with those listed for your microphone. I\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded screenshots for the standard Yeti to this folder on my Google Drive (Link coming soon!).\nOne finished, click \u0026ldquo;SAVE EEPROM\u0026rdquo; at the bottom of CM64, and the program will flash your new firmware.\nBlue Yeti USB Configurations\u003e Blue Yeti USB Configurations # Model VID PID Manufacturer String Product String Blue Yeti (Standard) B58E 9E84 Blue Microphones Yeti Stereo Microphone More models coming soon.\n5. Sanity Checks\u003e 5. Sanity Checks # Once you\u0026rsquo;ve flashed the EEPROM, a dialogue box will pop up telling you to disconnect and reconnect your device. Close the dialogue box and do as it says.\nWhen your Yeti reconnects, it should be fixed! One way to fully ensure this is to open Logitech Gaming Software and see if your device comes up.\nLooking for More Tech Tutorials?\u003e Looking for More Tech Tutorials? # There you have it! You can now get back to using your Yeti like before, and perhaps even start to enjoy the previously untapped potential of Blue Vo!ce.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more tutorials, be sure to check out some of my other posts.
